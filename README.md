# Code Block Adventure

# SCREENSHOTS IN SCREENSHOTS FOLDER!

Hello! This is Code Block Adventure a playground I made after my frustrations with current
 apps trying to teach coding. Other coding apps are super cool alowing kids to drag and drop to
 make their creations. But it does not really give any second step. I have talked to a bunch of
 middle schoolers that took coding classes and they thought coding was fun but the teachers
 were not prepared to jump them into more complex programming. So they got bored of coding and
 moved on. With Code Block Adventure my idea was to create an in between for block based
 languages and written code. Converting the blocks they click into swift code which later on
 they can start writing swift code instead of using the blocks. If this was a real app I would
 make further levels without the block guy and with more real life coding things. Which they can
 later on transition what they learned in this app to create their own swift apps.
 
 How to use:
 1. Look at the little blue guy you want to get them to move to the brown block (that is the goal) while avoiding the red blocks.
 2. Click the toolbox button to see all of the code blocks you have access to. Clicking one asks you how far you want them to "walk".
 3. Click the play button to test.
 
 Having a problem?
 Because of the lack of time if you mess up you may need to restart. Lucky for you down there is
 a variable called level with a nice little comment above it. There are 5 levels change the
 number to what level you want to skip to.
 
Also I made this in a 24h hackathon which I talk about in my written part (the only thing I added was more levels and a better look). So it might be a bit messy. Like me.
